I am a dedicated software developer with a passion for innovation, and I have recently completed my studies at Iowa State University, earning a degree in computer science.

My primary programming expertise is in Javascript, while I also possess proficiency in a diverse array of languages, tools, and libraries including SQL, C#, C, C++, NodeJS, ReactJS, Python, HTML, and CSS, to mention a few.
